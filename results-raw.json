This is a country which still uses kin punishment as a process and still uses innocent victims for human experimentation without informed consent. Mullerian probe is what the military did to me and I know, beyond a shadow of a doubt it was ordered by the military and the FBI and CIA knew about it. The experimentation done on me was to develop a way to torture people with words, torture hypnosis and a way to give a person an aneurysm, heart attack or cause asphyxiation by way of hypnosis and scripted torture. It is part of their Kubark manual and they call it project X. That&#39;s why you&#39;re seeing &quot;Ocean Gate,&quot; and why Twiiter changed its name to X and why Facebook changed its name too. MULLERIAN PROBE and it is being carried out by the CIA and the military on me for having a congenital birth defect called mullerian agenesis. I&#39;m actually still being castrated and tortured through my teeth with sound mental torture for reporting my rape, my kidnapping and the human experimentation carried out on me while under anesthesia and hypnosis. This country still has a human experimentation program and it is carried out on those with rare birth defects, those without families, people of higher intelligence, anyone in a prison cell or an asylum of this country and I was not meant to live through it. It isn&#39;t an investigation, it isn&#39;t for my own well being, it is a seek and destroy process written by the Toy Box Killers which were funded by the CIA to experiment on human beings. I have been screaming in fright and agony while being castrated for two full years while the CIA and FBI act as though this us for investigation. They had all the information for the last 18 years. My ovum was taken from my body and sold to foreign countries and used to make babies to sell to foreign countries as well. Again, I would strongly recommend anyone still living in this country to migrate to a real democracy. I reported that a Cambodian sleeper cell was doing these things and I still haven&#39;t been given my fundamental human rights back. If you&#39;re wondering who to blame, look no further than the CIA, the FBI and the military. Agencies who carry out foreign process on domestic United States soil should not exist but they do. The doctor who performed the mullerian probe on me under anesthesia filmed the procedure in order to blow the whistle on the process and she was targeted as well. It&#39;s a country which bastardizes intelligence, where slavery is still legal, where rape is used as a punishment and where murder, rape, incest, beastiality, extortion, sextortion, human trafficking, sex trafficking, child molestation, child abuse, child sex trafficking and terrorism are all legal as long as they&#39;re carried out by law enforcement or government agencies. These crimes were all committed against me while on domestic United States soil and I am WHITE and was BORN HERE so they care nothing about the truth, they value information only and only as far as they wish to use it. At no point should I have ever needed an attorney, the only thing I should have needed was an honorable, decent and loving country where kin punishment process isn&#39;t used for human experimentation and I never had any fundamental human rights, dignity or respect as a victim of terrorism. I&#39;ve screamed for a rescue until my larynx was sore for a week and no man, no woman, no law enforcement agencies or officers in or out of uniform offered me any form of comfort. Cowards. This country left my fate up to the very same agencies who tried to destroy me psychologically and dump my body over an embankment on Mothers day and they kept going. So that&#39;s all anyone needs to know about the humanity left in this country. Choke on that turkey.",

They were very dismissive to her and didn’t provide necessary help with translation despite the hospital website offering it.\nWe went overseas to an East Asian country (her home country from 30 years ago) and the doctors told her that the lump was cancerous and arranged for an operation after many meetings between specialists. They told us if she didn’t get the care, she’d have died in a few months time.\nOur “free” healthcare is also associated with huge wait times, nobody having family doctors, and a lack of actual care.",

He told me I have a bulging disc but that its not causing me pain, that ppl have this all the time and never even know it. That my pain is literally all in my head bc im bipolar (possible misdiagnosis still looking into it, might just be adhd) that its all literally in my head and there is nothing he can do for me. Went home Googled it, and hes right, but there is a small percentage of ppl who do feel a bulging disc in this location, and guess what? They are all women.  About a week or 2 later that bulging disc ruptured when I went to catch my at the time toddler from falling out of a low window sill he playing in. Spent 3 days unable to move or get out of bed at all screaming in pain, went back to ER and explained all this, to a WOMAN DOCTOR and she saw i was at the end of my rope and said we are gonna do tests till we find a reason to keep you, she did an mri of the disc and it had ruptured. Was admitted for pain control and to see my spine doc the next day when he came in. He comes in, no apology, sends me home WITH NO MEDS to see &quot;IF it heals on its own, come back to his office in 2 weeks&quot;. So went home for a truly agonizing 2 weeks unable to get out of bed and screaming night and day in pain. Went back 2 weeks later and nothing was better and he agreed that we needed to do surgery, but all this f***ing torture could have been avoided if he had just believed me to begin with. 😢",

My mother passed away due to ovarian cancer when my sibling and I were young, but I still remember her trying to kill herself with a belt in front of me and she also tried to drown us in a tub. She had a hysterectomy (I guess in a way you could say she was &quot;hysterical&quot; considering her whole fucking uterus was gone) after the cancer had spread and NEEDED supplemental estrogen and progesterone to balance her hormones. For some fucking reason, the male doctor took her off the hormone patch which triggered almost a delayed post-partum psychosis resulting in the above incidents. My aunt, who is a pharmacist, threatened the doctor that if he didn&#39;t put her back on, she would illegally swipe the drugs and do it herself, only then did the doctor put her back on; a cancer patient with two young children with one of her main hormone secreting organs removed who had proven that she would be a danger to herself and others because of his bullshit. I sometimes wonder if I wouldn&#39;t have had to grow up motherless, with a completely emotionally broken father who had to watch his wife die, if the doctors had just listened to her concerns before the cancer had progressed. All that &quot;nuisance stuff&quot; and &quot;pesky hormones&quot; turns out to be vital to the complex bodily and nervous system responses and need to be balanced by the secretion of sex organs or medications in many cases; brushing over it because you couldn&#39;t give a fuck about women&#39;s lives and health might result in a woman with late stage cancer trying to kill her fucking kids all because a man can&#39;t even begin to be bothered about the basics of hormonal regulation in women, despite prescribing medications for a patient with OVARIAN CANCER. This sort of prejudice costs lives and families.",

My mom was there I told him I&#39;m very honest with my mom if I was having sex she would know and that I was planning on waiting till marriage. He still did not believe me insisted I was going to have sex immediantly as soon as I got the meds. He made me feel like a worthless whore. Again I was 15 my flow was heavy I had consistent overwhelming pain and just wanted it to go down. He didn&#39;t really give me any information about the drugs he proscribe and sent me off with a script. That medication made me stay up till 2 am till I could finally purge my system. At 15 I didn&#39;t know that birth control worked by tricking your body into thinking your pregnant. This means you often experience pregnacy symptoms such as morning sickness. Im now on a progesterone based birth control that is more useful toward my needs of pain management were as the one he prescribed me was mainly estrogen based and more specifically for preventing pregnacy",

I had symptoms going back to my late teens, early 20&#39;s and no one ever even tried to diagnose what I was experiencing. Not only was I a woman but it also involved a condition that only affected women. I went through my life wondering why I had the problems I had. These problems affected my work. Also since I didn&#39;t know what the problem was I couldn&#39;t cope effectively. I muddled through but it would have been nice to know that I wasn&#39;t just crazy.",
