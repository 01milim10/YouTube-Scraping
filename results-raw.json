He told me I have a bulging disc but that its not causing me pain, that ppl have this all the time and never even know it. That my pain is literally all in my head bc im bipolar (possible misdiagnosis still looking into it, might just be adhd) that its all literally in my head and there is nothing he can do for me. Went home Googled it, and hes right, but there is a small percentage of ppl who do feel a bulging disc in this location, and guess what? They are all women.  About a week or 2 later that bulging disc ruptured when I went to catch my at the time toddler from falling out of a low window sill he playing in. Spent 3 days unable to move or get out of bed at all screaming in pain, went back to ER and explained all this, to a WOMAN DOCTOR and she saw i was at the end of my rope and said we are gonna do tests till we find a reason to keep you, she did an mri of the disc and it had ruptured. Was admitted for pain control and to see my spine doc the next day when he came in. He comes in, no apology, sends me home WITH NO MEDS to see &quot;IF it heals on its own, come back to his office in 2 weeks&quot;. So went home for a truly agonizing 2 weeks unable to get out of bed and screaming night and day in pain. Went back 2 weeks later and nothing was better and he agreed that we needed to do surgery, but all this f***ing torture could have been avoided if he had just believed me to begin with. 😢",

My mother passed away due to ovarian cancer when my sibling and I were young, but I still remember her trying to kill herself with a belt in front of me and she also tried to drown us in a tub. She had a hysterectomy (I guess in a way you could say she was &quot;hysterical&quot; considering her whole fucking uterus was gone) after the cancer had spread and NEEDED supplemental estrogen and progesterone to balance her hormones. For some fucking reason, the male doctor took her off the hormone patch which triggered almost a delayed post-partum psychosis resulting in the above incidents. My aunt, who is a pharmacist, threatened the doctor that if he didn&#39;t put her back on, she would illegally swipe the drugs and do it herself, only then did the doctor put her back on; a cancer patient with two young children with one of her main hormone secreting organs removed who had proven that she would be a danger to herself and others because of his bullshit. I sometimes wonder if I wouldn&#39;t have had to grow up motherless, with a completely emotionally broken father who had to watch his wife die, if the doctors had just listened to her concerns before the cancer had progressed. All that &quot;nuisance stuff&quot; and &quot;pesky hormones&quot; turns out to be vital to the complex bodily and nervous system responses and need to be balanced by the secretion of sex organs or medications in many cases; brushing over it because you couldn&#39;t give a fuck about women&#39;s lives and health might result in a woman with late stage cancer trying to kill her fucking kids all because a man can&#39;t even begin to be bothered about the basics of hormonal regulation in women, despite prescribing medications for a patient with OVARIAN CANCER. This sort of prejudice costs lives and families.",

My mom was there I told him I&#39;m very honest with my mom if I was having sex she would know and that I was planning on waiting till marriage. He still did not believe me insisted I was going to have sex immediantly as soon as I got the meds. He made me feel like a worthless whore. Again I was 15 my flow was heavy I had consistent overwhelming pain and just wanted it to go down. He didn&#39;t really give me any information about the drugs he proscribe and sent me off with a script. That medication made me stay up till 2 am till I could finally purge my system. At 15 I didn&#39;t know that birth control worked by tricking your body into thinking your pregnant. This means you often experience pregnacy symptoms such as morning sickness. Im now on a progesterone based birth control that is more useful toward my needs of pain management were as the one he prescribed me was mainly estrogen based and more specifically for preventing pregnacy",

I had asked my endocrinologist about the drops in my body temperature and after some discussion she told me I was PCOS. I looked at her blankly and she explained that it was poly cystic ovary syndrome. I had symptoms going back to my late teens, early 20's and no one ever even tried to diagnose what I was experiencing. Not only was I a woman but it also involved a condition that only affected women. I went through my life wondering why I had the problems I had. These problems affected my work. Also since I didn't know what the problem was I couldn't cope effectively. I muddled through but it would have been nice to know that I wasn't just crazy.",

Me doctor said it was an ear infection. She tried to fight it, but he wouldn’t let up. Eventually she took me to a different doctor, who instantly checked my tonsils, and saw they were the size of ping pong balls. I had surgery that day. She ended up becoming my primary, and my family was super bummed when she moved to a different state a decade later. Dr. Opal was the best and most compassionate doctor I had as a kid. My primary now is amazing though, she gets me any test I need, and sometimes will consult over the phone for advice/a question because then I don’t have to pay hospital fees.",
